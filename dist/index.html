    What's left / @TODO's
    - add nav link styling that grows underline, like I did here: https://freewomensclinic.mobi/schedule-an-appointment#Schedule
    - make nav visible on desktop view, that would be better UX experience, 
    - nav also needs to close when a link is clicked, used to work with the previous toggler, but that was bootstrap related, might have to do an event listener
    and figure out which event fires when that element is clicked
    - extra nav as a SFC to reuse on other pages
    - install vue-router and create a router.js file to handle routing
    - make the portfolio pages each a route and view
    - cleanup the my work modal css
    - figure out pagination 8 per page with load more button
    - add additional work examples

    - add robots.txt and related to not allow certain folders to be searched/indexed like my work folders raw-html
    - add photo bg attribution link to: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-city-with-tall-buildings--vi3S8WpeuE
